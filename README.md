This is a map app that you can create / delete pins and provide information to the pins in a pop up.  This allows many users to be using the app and each get a real time update as others use it.

I used Material-UI for the CSS and made it mobile responsive.  The Context usage is different than the way I prefer, but closer to the way people use Redux.  

I used Apollo server  and Mongoose for the database

GraphQl for the data fetching.

This was a course I took through Udemy to get a better understanding of GraphQl and web sockets.
